# For Developers
IME has been developed in Java 8 with Maven build on Intellij.  A JUNIT-based test library is also provided.

IME is built using open source java libraries,  including:
* ICAFE – read and writing IPTC data
* Javaxt – thumbnail creation
* Apache Commons Imaging – read and writing EXIF and Windows data
* Freemarker – for outputting HTML reports
* JavaAPI for KML generation.

I have used Launch4J to generate an Exe file and javapackager to create a dmg file for MacOS.  I have not done any packaging for Linux.

If anyone would like to build this project, I can provide additional information here.

Thanks to all developers for working on these libraries.
